# App-1-Android-Studio
This is an Android mobile phone application developed with Java and XML(design) in Android Studio. The code is in spanish and 
the final result can be chosen by english or spanish in language button.

The app is for a Canary Islands Restaurant called "Samarkanda" (there will be some Canary Islands names) based on a virtual menu that is 
showed in a touchable table where the client can choose what to eat and drink. When that client chooses at least 2 products from different 
categories, there will be shown a summary page with his choise that the waiter will see when he comes to the table for take the order, 
avoiding the interaction between the waiter and the client, the waiter will only need to see the table for know what the client ordered.

The final apk with the result is on apk folder.

*There is a bug on drinks that in some mobile phones devices or Android emulators works but not in others, is in process to fix it.
